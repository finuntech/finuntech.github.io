The FinUn.Tech Blog team has put together the site on [GitHub](http://www.github.com). The Blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), which is an open source Ruby based CMS platform that allows me to use Markdown to author our posts. It is fairly easy.
The purpose of this blog will be to discuss topics that lie in the intersection of Banking, Financial Services and Technology.
