# Business Service, Business Capability, Business Process: What's the difference?

The other day, I was in a meeting with a few senior leaders of a large bank and the above topic was discussed. There was a spirited debate and most folks felt that having so many constructs confuses the hell out of everyone and we should have one model.I got a chance to speak and I think I settled the debate. This is what I said.

Business processes and Business Capabilities are completely different constructs. 
Let’s imagine you are baking a cake. Don’t try it at home, but this is how you can do it.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease the cake pan. Mix two cups of flour, one and half cups of sugar, two eggs, 2 sticks of molten butter, one and half cups of milk, a teaspoon of vanilla. Mix thoroughly so that there are no lumps. Put in the oven and bake for 50 mins. Test for completeness with a fork or a toothpick — when it comes out without sticking your cake is done.

The above recipe is the example of a business process. You baked a simple white cake through a series of predefined & sequential steps. This recipe works only for a white cake. To make a fruit cake or a brownie you have to change the recipe.

Next, lets talk about business capabilities. You have a chef, you have flour, sugar, eggs, vanilla, butter, milk, dry fruits, chocolate, a bowl for mixing, a cake pan and an oven. These are your capabilities. The chef will decide how to bake the cake. You can make a wide variety of cakes. For example, the chef could break the eggs first, pour it in milk & vanilla and add sugar & butter to it — mix it together and then pour in the flour. She would have changed the process described above but still get the white cake done.

Finally, lets talk of business services. You open up a bakery shop to sell your cakes. That’s the service. For that service you need capabilities. For that service you also need recipes. Each has its own purpose. Now what would be the recurring business services if you were to open up a bake shop? Let’s assume, for simplicity, you leased an already existing bake shop. You would need to purchase ingredients, bake the cakes, sell the cakes, pay your employees and rent, offer some marketing & promotions and maintain your books & records. Each of these business services will have both processes and capabilities associated with it.

While processes are easily understood and process models are ubiquitous in any enterprise, let’s spend a few moments to understand a capability.A capability is a capacity to do something. Each capability will have to be discrete, non overlapping semantic construct and can have people, process and technology associated with it. Thus when you connect capabilities you get a very powerful enterprise view and such business capability based enterprise view is very important as processes are more fluid than capabilities. However, a business capability in itself doesn't lead to any outcome. A business service is a discrete offering that leads to an outcome. Further, Processes are often re-engineered but business capabilities are far more sticky. A Capability model is has its use cases like Application Portfolio Rationalization, Domain Driven Design, Micro-services and API design, Cloud Architecture, Legacy Modernization and so on.

In the banking world, *Stop Check* is an example of business service offering by the bank. This is shown in the figure above in this post. The Stop Check business service uses multiple business capabilities like *Customer*, *Account*, *Check* and a *Bank Service Representative*, and *Stop Payment*. The service and capabilities are likely the same for most banks, but each bank could have a slightly different process to request a Stop Check service. Some may allow self-service, others may require you to contact a representative. On the Left side of the figure, the business process is modeled using the [BPMN 2.0 notation](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0), while on the right you have a Sequence Digram showing the multiple Business Capabilities linked together in an Event Sequence.
