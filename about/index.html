	<h2>About</h2>
	<p></p>
	<p><span data-contrast="auto">FinUn.Tech&nbsp;is a blog site created by a team of management consultants working in the intersection of Banking and Financial Services and Information Technology.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Over the years, we have been witnessing the rapid progress of technological innovation and its impact on innovation and progress, both for individuals and business establishments. However, in parallel, there is also an <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obscurantism">obscurantist</a> trend to keep technology understanding out of reach for the non-technical person (someone who does not code on a day to day basis). We are of the opinion that this leads to elitism and is against the democratization of technology.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">On similar lines, as Finance Capital has progressed, there has been a rapid evolution of concepts in the Banking and Business world as well, with its own set of elitism and obscurantism in language and concepts. Often such concepts are difficult for technologists to grasp.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">As practitioners, we have often encountered this situation, often when facilitating and leading workshops that require the collaboration of business and technology users. In search of that elusive <em><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html">ubiquitous language</a></em>&nbsp;we have often found that there is truly none.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span data-contrast="auto">This blog is a humble attempt on our behalf to discuss technology concepts, both new and old, as well as advances in Banking and Financial Services in a manner that is easy to understand. Obviously, such an attempt comes at the risk of oversimplification. We humbly acknowledge that risk and posit that our target audience is not the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pedantic">pedantic</a> user but a common person with a baseline understanding of both the worlds.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span data-contrast="auto">For kicks-and-giggles, please find a technology specification document created with a technology bullshit generator available on the internet. It looks so real, isn't it?</span>&nbsp;</p>
