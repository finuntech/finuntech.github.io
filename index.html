	<h1>The FinUn.Tech Blog!</h1>
	<h2>Bridging Banking, Finance and Technology with a shared language.</h2>
	<p></p>
	<p><span data-contrast="auto">FinUn.Tech&nbsp;is a blog site created by a <a href="https://www.finun.tech/profile/" target="_blank">team of management consultants</a> working in the intersection of Banking and Financial Services and Information Technology.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><span data-contrast="auto">Over the years, we witness the rapid stride of technological advancement and its impact on innovation and progress, both for individuals and businesses. However, in parallel, there exists an <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obscurantism" target="_blank">obscurantist</a> trend to keep technology knowhow out of reach for the common man, esp. a person who does not work in the field of Information Technology. We believe that such elitism and is against the spirit of democratization of technology, and works to exacerbate the <a href= "https://www.britannica.com/topic/digital-divide" title="_blank">"Digital Divide"</a>.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><span data-contrast="auto">On similar lines, as Finance Capital has progressed, there has been a rapid evolution of concepts in the Banking and Business world as well, with its own set of elitism and obscurantism in language and concepts. Historically, the subject of Banking and Finance has always been restricted to business schools and practitioners. Financial concepts, esp. that spans beyond the matters of Personal Finance and simple Book-keeping, are often challenging concepts for the common man as well as techno concepts. It need not be that way.</span>&nbsp;</p>
	<p><span data-contrast="auto">As practitioners, we have often encountered this seemingly non-overlapping boundaries of knowledge, while facilitating and leading workshops that require the collaboration of business and technology users. The concepts and semantics of Finance and Technology are often very different. In contrast modern day Financial Institutions are critically dependent on technology, so much so that dare we say that technology lies at the heart of finance in that modern day. In search of that elusive <em><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html" target="_blank">ubiquitous language</a></em>&nbsp;that works for both finance and technology professionals, we have often found that there is truly none.</span>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;<span data-contrast="auto">This blog is a humble attempt on our behalf to discuss technology concepts, both new and old, as well as advances in Banking and Financial Services in a manner that is easy to understand. Obviously, such an attempt comes at the risk of oversimplification. We humbly acknowledge that risk and posit that our target audience is not the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pedantic" target="_blank">pedantic</a> user but a common person with a baseline understanding of both the worlds.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>&nbsp;<span data-contrast="auto">For kicks-and-giggles, please find a technology specification document created with a technology bullshit generator available on the internet. It looks so real, isn't it?</span>&nbsp;</p>
